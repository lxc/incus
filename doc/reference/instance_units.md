# Units for storage, memory and network limits

Any value that represents bytes or bits can make use of a number of suffixes to make it easier to understand what a particular limit is.

Both decimal and binary (kibi) units are supported, with the latter mostly making sense for storage limits.

The full list of bit suffixes currently supported for network limits is:

- bit (1)
- kbit (1000)
- Mbit (1000^2)
- Gbit (1000^3)
- Tbit (1000^4)
- Pbit (1000^5)
- Ebit (1000^6)
- Kibit (1024)
- Mibit (1024^2)
- Gibit (1024^3)
- Tibit (1024^4)
- Pibit (1024^5)
- Eibit (1024^6)

The full list of byte suffixes currently supported for storage and memory limits is:

- B or bytes (1)
- kB (1000)
- MB (1000^2)
- GB (1000^3)
- TB (1000^4)
- PB (1000^5)
- EB (1000^6)
- KiB (1024)
- MiB (1024^2)
- GiB (1024^3)
- TiB (1024^4)
- PiB (1024^5)
- EiB (1024^6)
