{note_ip_addresses_CIDR: "Incus uses the [CIDR notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing) where network subnet information is required, for example, `192.0.2.0/24` or `2001:db8::/32`. This does not apply to cases where a single address is required, for example, local/remote addresses of tunnels, NAT addresses or specific addresses to apply to an instance.",
snapshot_expiry_format: "Controls when snapshots are to be deleted (expects an expression like `1M 2H 3d 4w 5m 6y`)",
snapshot_pattern_format: "Pongo2 template string that represents the snapshot name (used for scheduled snapshots and unnamed snapshots)",
snapshot_pattern_detail: "The `snapshots.pattern` option takes a Pongo2 template string to format the snapshot name.\n\nTo add a time stamp to the snapshot name, use the Pongo2 context variable `creation_date`.\nMake sure to format the date in your template string to avoid forbidden characters in the snapshot name.\nFor example, set `snapshots.pattern` to `{{ creation_date|date:'2006-01-02_15-04-05' }}` to name the snapshots after their time of creation, down to the precision of a second.\n\nAnother way to avoid name collisions is to use the placeholder `%d` in the pattern.\nFor the first snapshot, the placeholder is replaced with `0`.\nFor subsequent snapshots, the existing snapshot names are taken into account to find the highest number at the placeholder's position.\nThis number is then incremented by one for the new name.",
snapshot_schedule_format: "Cron expression (`<minute> <hour> <dom> <month> <dow>`), a comma-separated list of schedule aliases (`@hourly`, `@daily`, `@midnight`, `@weekly`, `@monthly`, `@annually`, `@yearly`), or empty to disable automatic snapshots (the default)",
